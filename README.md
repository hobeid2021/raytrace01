# Ray tracer
## Description
This is a basic raytracer I wrote in C following the information outlined in Gabriel Gambetta's book ["Computer Graphics from Scratch"](https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/). However the prototype is rather simple and is only able to render hardcoded scenes of spheres of varying colour and material (from matte to reflective metallic) in addition to planes. A possible improvement to this program would be to implement the scene as a dynamic data structure which can read from a scene file.
## How to run
There are no dependancies other than a standard C library with the math library linked.
